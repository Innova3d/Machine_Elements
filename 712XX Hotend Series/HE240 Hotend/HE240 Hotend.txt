# HE240 Hotend

This is our newest hotend design featuring NO PEEK.
It is still lined with PTFE down to the thermal transition zone.
This allows printing in both PLA and ABS easily.
We are in development of the HE280 Jet Kit for this hotend that
will allow printing at 280c by moving the PTFE liner up away from any 
heat that would affect the stability of the liner.
